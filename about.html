								<h3>Seneca Valley Boys Volleyball Varsity Captain</h3>
								<p> I have played on the varsity team at my high school for the past three years and lettered for two of them. We have made the playoffs the past four years and even reached the State Semi-Finals three years ago. This year I have had the priviledge of being a leader both on and off the court, an experience that has improved my team building and communication skills! </p>
